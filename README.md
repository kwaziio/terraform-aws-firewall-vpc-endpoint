# Terraform AWS VPC Endpoint Firewall Module by KWAZI

Terraform Module for Creating a Standardized VPC Endpoint Security Group on AWS

## Getting Started

> NOTE: This section assumes that you have Terraform experience, have already created an AWS account, and have already configured programmatic access to that account via access token, Single-Sign On (SSO), or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. If you need help, [checkout our website](https://www.kwazi.io).

The simplest way to get started is to create a `main.tf` file with the minimum configuration options. You can use the following as a template:

```HCL
##################################
# Example Terraform Module Usage #
##################################

module "terraform_aws_firewall_vpc_endpoint" {
  source = "kwaziio/aws/firewall-vpc-endpoint"

  network_id = "VPC_ID"
}
```

In the example above, you should replace the following templated values:

Placeholder | Description
--- | ---
`VPC_ID` | Replace this w/ the ID of the VPC Associated w/ this Security Group

> TIP: Check [our example](examples/complete/main.tf) for a working example of provisioning the AWS VPC mentioned above.
